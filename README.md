# 8.-Star-Wars-Data-Analysis-Python :moon::rocket:
A personal project to analyse data from a Star Wars survey. Python Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib

## Thoughts on starting this project
My seventh programming project, in Python. 

After learning about some Python Libraries commonly used in data analysis, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib, I figured I should put what I have learnt to the test, by
making a personal project on data analysis, and familiar myself on the process of analysing data (apart from the collecting data part since I get the dataset online)
such as Cleaning and Preparing data, Modelling and Analysing data, and sharing any discovery about said dataset.

<br>

Computer program used for coding: VS Code

## Repository directory description:
Let's start with:
1. Sources and Context
2. Cleaning and Preparing Data
3. Data Modelling and Analysis

<br>

<br>

**1. Sources and Context**
The Dataquest website provides some guidance and provides the tasks in order to analyse some of the data in the dataset. The 'Starwars_data_analysis_project' folder
is organised to tasks from the website. '1.Task1.py' to '4.Task4.py' is on Cleaning and Preparing the data while '5.Task5.py' to '6.Task6.py' is on Data Modelling and
Analysis. '7.Task7.py' and '7.Task7.5.py' is to analyse another aspect of data from the dataset.

Learnt more regarding how to clean data from the cleaning data guide (in source(s))

## Thoughts after the project
This is my first time creating an app that can be used to engage with users via an app. I have previously taken a look at other GUI Python libraries such as
Flutter and Dart (more for mobile apps and require an Android emulator to work) and noticed the way they work does have their similarities. (e.g. using of 
Widgets, though they offer different types of Widgets)

<br>

To be improved:
* Flaw is that when set button is pushed, nothing happens, until the timer is up and the alarm sound starts playing. I believe it will be much more user-friendly if
I am able to add a visual countdown timer on the app instead of just in the terminal which the ueser of the app will not be able to see, Showing the datetime when
the timer will go off will make the app more user-friendly as well.
* Swapping the clock button with a real-time counting up clock would be better, instead of clicking it whenever they need a time reference. Still haven't figure that out... 
but should be definitely possible
* Positioning of widgets are awkward as well, definitely ways to improve on the positioning.
